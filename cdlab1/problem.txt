Problem: Write a program to implement a program that takes an input
string from the console and verifies it against a Deterministic
Finite Automaton which is given through a separate file.


dfa.txt file structure:

n states, m inputs: n x m	// dfa format

0      // Initial State
1 2    // Set of Final State(s)
0 1    // DFA starts from 3rd line
-1 2   // -1 means no transition
-1 0


Input: 0011	Output: STRING ACCEPTED
